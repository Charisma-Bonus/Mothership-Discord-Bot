## Setup

Use of VSCode is _highly_ recommended for building and development.

Install latest Node.js/lts and have npm up-to-date.

In main project folder run the following in terminal to download requirements

``` terminal
npm install
```

Dependencies and dev dependencies will be installed.

Copy or rename `./secrets/sample-config.json` to `./secrets/config.json` with bot token and prefix set in the file. Debug output can be enabled here as well.
